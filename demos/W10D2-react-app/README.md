## Job Widget App

To get this app up and running, run the following commands in terminal (make
sure that you are in the top-level of the `W10D2-react-app` directory):

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`

In order for the app to work properly you will also need to run the Job API
locally. In a separate terminal tab navigate to the [jobs-api](../jobs-api) project and
run the following commands:

1. `bundle install`
2. `rails s`
