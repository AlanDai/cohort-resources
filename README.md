# Instructor Section

* Each cohort will have its own branch.  The master branch serves as the skeleton branch.  Whenever you want to make a new branch for a cohort, branch from the master branch and name it as such: ```git branch <month-start day-year>```.  

## Demos

*  Demos from lecture live within the demos repository.  For every demo, checkout the appropriate branch for the current cohort, cd into the demo directory, and look for the lecture you are scribing for.  The demo will be done within the folder. After finishing the demo, add,commit and push your work.
