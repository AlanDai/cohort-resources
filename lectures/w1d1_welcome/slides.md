### Logistics and Expectations
---

#### Daily Projects

+ Work on the phases in order
  + Always read the instructions before starting the project!
+ Make sure you understand every single line of code that you write.
  + If you or your partner writes a line you do not understand, stop and try to understand it - talk it out!
+ It is more important to understand than to race to finish.
  + The projects are designed for deep thinking, building, and problem solving.  They are not designed to be finished in a day.  

---

#### Assessments

+ Academic Integrity
  + No notes
  + No copying
  + No sharing of assessments
  + No discussion with others during assessment
+ Violations will result in dismissal
+ All assessments are timed

---

#### Foundations Assessments

+ There are two: W2D1 and W3D1
+ Failing either assessment will result in _deferral_ to the next cohort
+ We want to make sure you are ready before continuing to Week 3

---

#### Core Curriculum Assessments

+ There are 6 Assessments
+ No consequences for failing one assessment
+ Retake if you fail a second assessment
  + One retake per person
  + The retake is given on same day
  + It is a different version of the assessment
+ Failing the retake will result in _dismissal_
+ If you pass a retake, you stay in the course.  If you fail one more additional assessment you will be dissmissed from the course.

---

#### Assessment Advice
+ Assessments are learning tools
  + Assessments are used to confirm and solidify understanding.
  + Spaced retrieval and testing are proven to aid in learning.
  + Assessments are also check points.
+ The material covered each day builds on the last
+ Everybody can score 100%
+ If you get a bug: relax, breath deep, and read the error message
+ Read the spec files

---

#### Tips For Success at a/A

+ Be present & punctual
+ Complete your work to the best of your ability
+ Complete your homwork, readings, and videos every night before the next day.
  + App Academy is a fast paced course with very specific amounts of time allotted for each day.  
  + Stay on top of the homework and you will set yourself up for success.
+ Prioritize understanding over completion for the daily projects
+ Ask for help!!!
+ Focus full-time on App Academy
  + App Academy is a huge commitment, but in the grand scheme of things 16 weeks is not a huge amount of time.

---

#### Growing As a Developer

+ Collaborate: 
  +Talk to one another - speak code!
+ The best thing you can learn is how to be independent
  + how to read error messages
  + how to debug and use the stack trace
  + how to utilize Google and Stack Overflow

---

#### Code of Conduct

**If you experience a code of conduct violation**

+ Hold Your Peers Accountable
  + Report it through Progress Tracker
  + Approach an instructor
