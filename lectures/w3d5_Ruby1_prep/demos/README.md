The lines where the bugs live are located in the `where_bugs_are.md file`.  
Keep in mind that these are the lines that bugs live when you havent fixed the bugs.  
Therefore, make sure that you have a good understanding of what all the bugs are so that lecture goes as smoothly as possible.  
This lecture is not about how fast you can solve the problems or how clever you are.  
This is a lecture to show them debugging techniques, making sure that they understand the difference between `continue`(c), `next`(n), and `step`(s). 
Also, making sure that they understand how to effectively take advantage of the spec file. 
Follow what is outlined in the `assessment_tips.md` file to guide you while you debug the buggy version.  
Make sure to highlight everything specified in the file.  
The `assessment_tips.md` file can also be found as the main README in the master branch of `cohort_resources` following the path of `assessement_tips/ruby_1`. 
It's placed in this folder so that you may have an easy reference during the lecture.  
Before AND after lecture make sure that students know how to get to `cohort resources` `assessement_tips/ruby_1` README so that they can reference it while they are studying for the assessment. 
DO NOT do buggy version demo in this folder. Make sure that you make a copy of the demo so that you can put it in the cohorts branch within their demos folder in cohort resources after the lecture. 
That way we can use `a01p_buggy` as a template for future lectures. DO NOT place the solution to buggy version on cohort resources.  
This would force students to solve the bugs on their own and pay attention during lecture.
