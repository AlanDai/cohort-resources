## WARNING

### Throw out everything you _think_ you know about writing functions.

## What you're _not_ going to do...

>>>> * Use loops*
>>>> * Modify a method argument
>>>> * Use an optional, private argument
>>>> * Think in linear or procedural terms
>>>> * Be mentally refreshed at the end of the day (sorry)

>>*Recursion & iteration can be used together, so you will use loops but not to recurse.

---

## What you _are_ going to do...

* Write methods that call themselves
* Break problems down incrementally
* "Trust" that your method already works for all previous cases
* Learn a new way of thinking and programming! &nbsp; :D

## What is a recursive function?

* Calls itself ("recurses")
* Solves a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems
* Has a _**base case**_ â€“ simplest "already solved" condition
* Builds back up incrementally using an _**inductive step**_

Note:

Inductive step is how we use the return value of the previous step to
determine the current result.

# Final Thoughts

## The Recursion Process

 1. Simplify the problem
 2. Identify the base case
 3. Write the inductive step

## Remember


>>> * You can use Recursion and Iteration _together_
>>> * Each recursive call will return before anything else happens - just like any method call
>>> * Always assume you're getting back the same data type!

## Soapbox Moment

Experiment. Try things. Do it _wrong_. The point isn't to be perfect. It's to _learn_.
