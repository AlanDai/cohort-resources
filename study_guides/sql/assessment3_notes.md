#Working with Sqlite3
1. In order to go into a database that you need query from, you do: sqlite3 (name of database)
2. .tables shows all the tables that you're working with 
3. ".mode column" makes the output from the query calls more readable by returning the information in data form 
4. ".headers on" shows the names of each column so it makes it easier to see what each column represents 
5. Making a query call is simple, just write out the query call in vs code and copy and paste it into the terminal. Make sure that you place a semi colon at the end.
