# Tips ######

1.  Read the README.md
2.  Run specs in the order provided 
3.  No prior knowledge of the game is required. All rules are in the readme. But study the game for the real one. 


# Common Gotcha's #######

*   Make sure to look at the rspec and C&P the  desired error message. Easy to typo and hard to debug. 

*   Not sure what a spec is asking? Open the spec file and take a look at how and what that spec is testing. Often times the RSpec will tell you exactly what to do. 

*   Instance variables don't need to be in the initialize to exist (re: @hand in the player)

*   Note that the Dealer class inherits from the Player class. Elaborate on that.
