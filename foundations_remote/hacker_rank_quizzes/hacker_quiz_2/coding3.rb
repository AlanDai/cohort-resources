# write a method, nth_fibonacci, that takes in a number n and returns the n-th number of the fibonacci sequence. 

#The fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers where:
##the first and second numbers are both 1 
##the next number of the sequence can be generate by taking the sum of the previoous
##two numbers of the sequence 

#for example, the beginning of the fibonacci sequence is 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89...
# Examples
p nth_fibonacci(1)  # => 1
p nth_fibonacci(2)  # => 1
p nth_fibonacci(3)  # => 2
p nth_fibonacci(4)  # => 3
p nth_fibonacci(5)  # => 5
p nth_fibonacci(6)  # => 8
p nth_fibonacci(7)  # => 13
p nth_fibonacci(10) # => 55
p nth_fibonacci(25) # => 75025
